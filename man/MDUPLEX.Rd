\title{'DSAM' - MDUPLEX algorithm}
\usage{
MDUPLEX(data, control)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataset should be matrix or Data.frame. The format should be as follows: Column one is a subscript vector used to mark each data point (each row is considered as a data point); Columns from 2 to N-1 are the input data, and Column N are the output data.}

\item{control}{User-defined parameter list, where each parameter definition refers to the par.default function.}
}
\value{
Return the training, test and validation subsets. If the original data are required to be split into two subsets, the training and test subsets can be combined into a single calibration subset.
}
\description{
This is a modified MDUPLEX algorithm, which is also deterministic, with details given in Zheng et al. (2022).
